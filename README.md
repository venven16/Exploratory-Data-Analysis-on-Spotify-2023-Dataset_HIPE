**Library:** **`import numpy as np`**

**Description:** A powerful Python Library for numerical computing is mostly used for managing arrays and mathematical calculations. Numerous mathematical operations and functions essential to scientific computing and data management are supported.


**Library:** **`import pandas as pd`** 

**Description:** A Library for data analysis and manipulation that simplifies working with structured data by offering data structures like DataFrames and Series. It is crucial for data science projects since it is frequently used for data preparation, cleansing, and investigation.


**Library:** **`import seaborn as sns`**

**Description:** A Matplotlib-based data visualization package was created significantly to facilitate the creation and interpretation of statistical visuals. Seaborn offers high-level functionality and aesthetic themes to make complex visualizations like heat maps and category plots easier to understand.


**Library:** **`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`**

**Description:** A popular Python charting toolkit that provides low-level control to produce a range of static, animated, and interactive representations. It is helpful for intricate plot modification and forms the basis for various visualization libraries (such as Seaborn).


**Read the Data Set that was given to us:** 

**Function:** **`spotify = pd.read_excel('spotify-2023.xlsx') spotify`**

**Description:** This code displays the contents of a Pandas DataFrame named `spotify` after loading data from an Excel file called `spotify-2023.xlsx`. It reads the file and arranges the data in a structured manner using `pd.read_excel`, which makes it simple to examine, work with, and display in Python. Spotify, in the end, is to declare the DataFrame needed.
